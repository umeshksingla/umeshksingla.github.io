These are some resources that I have greatly enjoyed reading and have helped me better understand my interests, my position in the field, and how I can contribute. The list contains books, research papers, review articles, lessons on academic life, courses, or talks. My idea is to turn it into a sort of bookshelf - rich with pieces from science, art, or people's experiences.

### Papers

**[Unsupervised identification of the internal states that shape natural behavior](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0533-x)**  
**Adam J. Calhoun et al. (Nature Neuroscience, 2019)**  
A great way to digest this paper and understand the implications of this particular work as well as in general progress on automating animal behavior is this article by Quanta Magazine, [To Decode the Brain, Scientists Automate the Study of Behavior](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-decode-the-brain-scientists-automate-the-study-of-behavior-20191210/) from 2019.

**[Characterizing a psychiatric symptom dimension related to deficits in goal-directed control](https://elifesciences.org/articles/11305)**  
**Claire Gillan et al. (eLife 2016)**

**[Dynamic sensory cues shape song structure in Drosophila](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13131)**  
**Philip Coen et al. (Nature 2014)**  
Check out the accompanying [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13208) if you don't want to get too much into the technical details.

**[The discovery of structural form](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0802631105)**  
**Charles Kemp and Joshua Tenenbaum (PNAS, 2008)**  
On the ability of humans to construct representations of their environment using only a few observations, transfer those learnings to different environments and leverage them to control their behavior. Follow up with the [TEM](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.024) paper.

**[Lévy flight random searches in biological phenomena](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437102011573)**  
**G.M Viswanathan et al. (Physica A, 2002)**  
This paper touches upon advantages of Levy walks over brownian motion for random searches and different _kinds_ of Levy walks that originate in the wild depending on how sparse or how mobile the target is. Check out the article [Random Search Wired Into Animals May Help Them Hunt](https://www.quantamagazine.org/random-search-wired-into-animals-may-help-them-hunt-20200611/) by Quanta Magazine from 2020 that summarizes the similar research done across a variety of species since 2002 in an easy-to-understand manner.

### Tutorials and Reviews

**[Introduction to Decision Making models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvLpFnlm39M)**  
**Paul Cisek (MAIN 2020)**

**[The challenges of lifelong learning in biological and artificial systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2022.09.022)**  
**Sashank Pisupati and Yael Niv (Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2022)**  
Describes very neatly the problem of continual learning and the framework of contextual or latent-causes proposed to solve it giving a new shape to the problem of learning compared to previous approaches that track a fixed set of parameters. Latent-causes framework is motivated to capture the basis of inductive biases. Further, it talks about few behavioral and neural studies using the framework, and its interesting applications in computational psychiatry.

**[The what, how, and why of naturalistic behavior](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438822000435)**  
**Ann Kennedy (Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 2022)**

**[Resynthesizing behavior through phylogenetic refinement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-019-01760-1)**  
**Paul Cisek (Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 2019)**  
A simpler title would be "Neuroscience needs evolution" but that's actually another [paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0518). I found the best way to enjoy this paper was to skip the paper and watch this [debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-Hb_Ljx3o) instead hosted by Learning Salon.

[//]: # (It's actually one of the chapters in the linked book. I resonated with a particular section of this chapter _Is Science Undervalued?_ very well. I think the title does not justify the content the best but if you find yourselves questioning if doing science is &#40;or is not&#41; the only thing worth living for, you might find an answer here.)
