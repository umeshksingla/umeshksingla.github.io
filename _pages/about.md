I work at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) with [Mala Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu/) and [Jonathan Pillow](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) as a research specialist with a focus on computational ethology and cognitive science.

I did my MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I worked with [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) (now at NYU) at Neural Computation and Reinforcement Learning lab. I received my BS in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from IIIT Hyderabad with a minor in Cognitive Science.

My main research interest is being able to describe the behavior of a complex system at multiple levels. Some of the systems I find exciting are the individual and collective behavior of animals and humans - how they explore, interact, and update their beliefs about the world. Beyond describing the physical principles underlying the organization of such systems, I am also interested in investigating neural computations underlying individual variations and flexible behavior. I also continue to explore if or how these findings can inform machine learning, or robotics, or aid psychiatry. For my research, I like to derive from and draw connections across various disciplines, including computer science, neuroscience, ecology, cognitive science, and social sciences.

Outside the lab, I like to spend time at the beach, at the gym, watching cinema, or exploring the city.
