I work at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) with [Mala Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu/) and [Jonathan Pillow](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) as a research specialist where I am studying social interactions in _Drosophila melanogaster_.

I obtained my MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) (now at NYU). I received my BS in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from IIIT Hyderabad with a minor in Cognitive Science.

I am interested in deciphering the computational principles underlying various cognitive processes, what causes them to 
deviate, and how those deviations manifest.

I study decision-making in animals and humans in various settings - exploratory, planning, changing motivational states, 
social contexts, multiple sensory inputs, varying environmental factors, and such. 
I like to think about sequences, timescales, internal states, meta-learning, and ever-evolving representations.

For my research, I like to derive from and draw connections across various disciplines, including computer science, neuroscience, 
ecology, and social sciences. 
My long-term goal is to help promote scientific awareness about mental disorders in the psychiatry community and society as a whole, 
by offering simple explanations about cognitive processes and underlying computational principles through my research.


[//]: # (I also find dynamics of large scale systems, such as global economies, ecosystems interactions, urban infrastructure or social networks, fascinating.)

Outside the lab, I like to spend time at the beach, at the gym, watching cinema, or exploring the city.
