I joined UC San Diego in 2020 as an MS student in Computer Science. I am pursuing my thesis in the Neural Computation and Reinforcement Lab advised by [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu). The goal of my research is to develop computational methods to understand how animals explore their environment and plan their actions.

I am interested in interdisciplinary research problems spanning computer science and the natural world (ecology, animal behavior, climate, agriculture, and such). I am <u>currently looking for research assistant or data scientist positions</u> in academia or industry.

I received my BS in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from IIIT Hyderabad with a minor in Cognitive Science.

Aside from research, I like to go to the beach, to the gym, listen to music, or bake in my free time.

Research
--------
For my **masters** thesis, I am working with Professor [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) to study exploration in complex environments and trying to explain structure exhibited by animals while navigating a maze. I am particularly interested in how reinforcement learning can be used to model exploration and planning in animals.

During my **undergrad** at IIITH, I worked with Professors [Bapi S Raju](https://sites.google.com/view/bccl-iiith/home) and [Vinoo Alluri](https://www.vinooalluri.com/) in the Cognitive Science department as part of the undergraduate research program. I worked on analyzing structural and functional MRI scans for any addiction-related alterations. Work done as part of this program:
