I am a second-year MS student in Computer Science working with [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) in the Neural Computation and Reinforcement Learning Lab at UC San Diego. The goal of my research is to develop computational methods to understand how animals explore their environment and plan their actions. I also collaborate with [NEAT Labs](https://neatlabs.ucsd.edu/index.html) to help understand animal decision-making behavior and neural activity from various experiments using Bayesian inference tools.

I am interested in interdisciplinary research problems spanning computer science and the natural world (ecology, animal behavior, climate, agriculture, and such). I am <u>currently looking for positions in academia or industry</u> that would allow me to continue my research in machine learning and cognitive science, with a focus on computational neuroscience or ethology.

I received my BS in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from IIIT Hyderabad with a minor in Cognitive Science.

Aside from research, I like to go to the beach, to the gym, listen to music, or bake in my free time.

For my **masters** thesis, I am working with Professor [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) to study exploration in complex environments and trying to explain structure exhibited by animals while navigating a maze. I am particularly interested in how reinforcement learning can be used to model exploration and planning in animals.

During my **undergrad** at IIITH, I worked with Professors [Bapi S Raju](https://sites.google.com/view/bccl-iiith/home) and [Vinoo Alluri](https://www.vinooalluri.com/) in the Cognitive Science department as part of the undergraduate research program. I worked on analyzing structural and functional MRI scans for any substance addiction-related alterations. Work done as part of this program:
