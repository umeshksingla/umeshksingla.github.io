I am an MS student in Computer Science at UC San Diego. I am interested in engineering systems - software, distributed, or machine learning. I am particularly interested in learning about site reliability engineering and good software architecture.

I also like to read about human behavior and think about ways to decipher structure in the natural world using ML tools in order to build better autonomous systems.

I like to go to the beach, to the gym, listen to music, or bake in my free time.
