I work at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) with [Mala Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu/) and [Jonathan Pillow](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) as a research assistant where I am studying social interactions in fruir flies.

{: style="text-align: justify" } 
I obtained my MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.com) (now at NYU). I received my BS in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from IIIT Hyderabad with a minor in Cognitive Science.

I am interested in understanding the neuro-computational principles underlying various cognitive processes, what causes them to deviate, and how those deviations manifest in our daily lives.

I study decision-making in animals and humans in various settings - exploratory, planning, multisensory contexts, or social environments, and across timescales.

For my research, I like to derive from and draw connections across various disciplines, including computer science, neuroscience, ecology, and social sciences.


[//]: # (I also find dynamics of large scale systems, such as global economies, ecosystems interactions, urban infrastructure or social networks, fascinating.)

Outside the lab, I like to spend time at the beach, watching cinema, biking, or exploring the city.
