I work at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) with [Mala Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu/) and [Jonathan Pillow](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) as a research specialist with a focus on computational ethology and cognitive science.

I did my MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego where I worked with [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) (now NYU) at Neural Computation and Reinforcement Learning lab. I received my BS in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from IIIT Hyderabad with a minor in Cognitive Science.

My main research interest is in being able to come up with descriptions of a complex system at multiple levels. Some of the systems I find exciting are the individual and collective behavior of animals and humans - how they explore, interact, and update their beliefs about the world. Beyond describing the physical principles underlying the organization of such systems, I am also interested in investigating neural computations underlying flexible behavior in naturalistic settings. I also continue to explore if, or how, these findings can inform machine learning or robotics, or aid psychiatry or climate science. For my research, I like to derive from and draw connections across a range of disciplines including computer science, neuroscience, ecology, cognitive science, and social sciences.

Outside the lab, I like to spend time at the beach, at the gym, watching cinema, or exploring the city.

Research

**Exploration in complex naturalistic behavior**

For my **masters** thesis, I worked with [Marcelo Mattar](https://www.mattarlab.com) to study exploration and explain the efficiency and higher-order structure, if any, exhibited by freely navigating animals in a labyrinth. We surveyed existing algorithms in the field of classical and deep reinforcement learning used to model exploration in sequential environments. We found most of the algorithms were not generalizable outside their intended domains, or they performed either very optimally (similar to doing depth-first search with no resource constraints) or very randomly (similar to wandering around with no memory or planning). However, animals generally lie in between as we know from various experiments. We looked further and found connections in spatial ecology and the temporal abstraction in RL. A simple rule that persists the same decision for multiple steps was able to capture most of the mice exploratory behavior and also reduced the average uncertainty in decisions at each turn. We are currently designing a behavior experiment to see if the same holds in humans as well.

**Bayesian models of rodent behavior**

We modeled choice data from various rodent behavior experiments: 2AFC, delay discounting, and probabilistic reversal learning, in Stan using the frameworks of Reinforcement Learning and Hierarchical Bayes. We analyzed model-based and model-free learning components in their choice behavior and studied incremental learning over trials.
