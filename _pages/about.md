I am a PhD student in the Computation and Language lab at UC Berkeley, advised by [Steve Piantadosi](http://colala.berkeley.edu). 

Before, I worked at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute as a research assistant in the labs of [Jonathan Pillow](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) and [Mala Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu/). I obtained my MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Marcelo Mattar](https://www.mattarlab.com). Long time ago, I received my BS in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad.
