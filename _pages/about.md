I am a computer science MS student working with [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) in the Neural Computation and Reinforcement Lab at UC San Diego. The goal of my research is to develop computational methods to understand how animals explore their environment and plan their actions.

In my masters thesis, I am interested in how reinforcement learning can be used to model exploration and planning in animals. We study exploration in complex environments and try to explain structure exhibited by animals while navigating a maze.

I am interested in interdisciplinary research problems spanning computer science and natural world (ecology, animal behavior, human interaction, climate, agriculture, and such). I am currently looking for research assistant or data scientist positions in academia or industry.

**Prior to UCSD**, I received my undergrad in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad with a minor in Cognitive Science. As part of undergraduate research program, I worked on analyzing structural and functional MRI scans for any addiction-related alterations. Visit [Past](past) for more.

Aside from research, I like to go to the beach, to the gym, listen to music, or bake in my free time. Check out my [Bookshelf](bookshelf.md) to know more.
