I am a computer science MS  student working with [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu) in the Neural 
Computation and Reinforcement Lab at UC San Diego. I study exploration
and planning in sequential settings in animals and artificial agents. I am interested in 
interdisciplinary research problems spanning computer 
science and the natural sciences (particularly ecology, ethology, and earth sciences). 
I like to think about ways to decipher hidden structure in the natural world.

Before this, I received my BTech in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad with a 
minor in Cognitive Science. As part of undergraduate research program, I worked 
on analyzing structural and functional MRI scans for any addiction-related alterations.

Aside from research, I like to go to the beach, to the gym, listen to instrumental metal, or 
bake in my free time. Check out my [Bookshelf](bookshelf.md) to know more.

Research
--------

My masters thesis studies exploration in sequential decision-making in mice in 
maze-like environments. We are investigating how animals deviate from optimality
in such decisions, by analyzing naturalistic behavior data, and fitting and 
comparing computational models. This involves topics from AI and naturalistic behavior, 
including reinforcement learning, cognitive science, and behavior modeling and prediction.



Goal
----
My goal is to advance our understanding of animal behavior and leverage it to 
build better autonomous systems. I like to use a combination of experimental,
observational and computational approaches to understand a given phenomenon.
