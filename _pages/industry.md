Before UCSD, I spent two wonderful years at [Joveo](https://www.joveo.com/), an early-stage programmatic advertising startup in the recruitment space, as a machine learning engineer. I designed and developed data pipelines, set up monitoring systems to increase system observability, and collaborated with the data science team on various ML projects.

During my undergrad, I interned with the Data Intelligence division at Samsung Research Institute in the summer of 2017.

I was also a Google Summer of Code student with the open-source organization [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) during my undergrad and later served as a mentor.
